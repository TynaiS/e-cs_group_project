Drowsiness detection

Drowsiness detection is a safety technology which helps prevent accidents or monitor health. For example: nowadays, drowsiness of drivers is one of the main reasons behind road accidents.

We have developed an effective solution to address the issue of drowsiness in various contexts. Using the power of Python and OpenCV, our drowsiness detection system focuses on monitoring eye closure, and then provides alerts.
